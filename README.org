* Introduction
* Goal

  Be a lightweight alternative to ~(elpy)~
  following the *Emacs/Elisp* philosophy.

* Version

  - Alpha: 0.0.1

* Dependencies

  - comint
  - python-mode (optional)

* Tested on

  | Emacs   | 27.1 | 28.0 |
  | FreeBSD | 12.1 | 12.2 |
  | OpenBSD |  6.8 |      |

* Installation
** Manually

   Clone =Ipy= repository to an arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

       $ git clone https://github.com/lambdart/ipy ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/ipy

   #+END_SRC

   Add =Ipy= directory to =load-path= in your
   Emacs initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/ipy/full/path")

   ;; load ipy feature
   (require 'ipy nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach:
     - =M-x load-file RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET ipy RET=

** Compile

   * Note: Optional (recommended).

   To compile the files to the =Elisp= byte-compiled representation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

       [at-ipy-root-directory]$ gmake

   #+END_SRC

* Usage
* Customize

  * Note: To see all the options from =Emacs= directly, and to customize it,
    just type: =M-x customize-group RET ipy RET=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist
  tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is
  the more he will admire it, if you make something so clusterfucked he
  can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so
  complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals in
  Academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you're a
  genius.
